= Whelper =

To build and start whelper:

[source,bash]
----
  mvn package jetty:run
----
  
Once jetty server starts navigate to:

http://localhost:8080/grid.jsp

The war file can also be deployed to tomcat as is.  `whelper-1.2.war` would be exploded as `whelper` in the tomcat `webapps` folder.

= API =

Whelper currently supports a single API, exposed at:

http://localhost:8080/api/grid

The API accepts a POST operation with a JSON body with two elements - `gridType` and `cells`.  `gridType` must be `GRID` for now and `cells` must be a 2-D array of strings which must be square.  The API will return a list of strings that can be made from a grid with the given input cells.  Cells may be empty and can contain more than one character.

Example input:

[source,json]
----
{"gridType":"GRID",
 "cells": [ ["C","A","QU"],
            ["","S","O"],
            ["A","T",""] ] }
----

results in the following return:

[source,json]
----
["CASA","CAST","OAST","QUA","QUOTA","QUOTAS","SAC","SAT","SOT","STOA","TAS"]
----
